## Inspiration
#### Caesar Cipher
Caesar Cipher is one of the earliest and simplest method of encryption. It is a substitution cipher, where each letter of a given text is replaced by a latter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. 

Eg: If the **key** is **1**, A would be replaced by B, B becomes C and so on. 

The method is apparently named after Julius Caesar who is said to have used it to communicate with his officials


## What it does
This Program allows you to encrypt your text using Caesar cypher with a key of your choosing.


## How we built it
Built using python and has two functions one to encrypt and the other to decrypt


## How to use
<ol>
<li>Run the program using python: _python Caesar.py_.</li>
<li>The program asks for text and key. Input both of those.</li>
<li>Next, it asks you whether to encrypt or decrypt. Enter **1** to Encrypt and &**2** to Decrypt.</li>
<li>The encrypted text will be displayed on your screen.</li>
</ol>


## Challenges we ran into
The algorithm to replace each letter using the key given was difficult to come up with.


## What we learned
The technique of Caesar Cipher and how to implement it in code
